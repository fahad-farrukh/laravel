Laravel 5 - Fundamentals

http://slides.com/gr8rizwan/

Install Composer
	sudo curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer

Create Laravel Project
	sudo composer create-project laravel/laravel /opt/lampp/htdocs/laravel

	REMOVE EXISTING VCS: YES

Give write permissions to "htdocs/laravel" project folder
	sudo chmod 0777 -R laravel/

Run the server through "artisan" (available only within laravel project folder)
	php artisan serve
	// Laravel development server started on http://localhost:8000/

Project can also be accessed through direct URL
	e.g http://localhost/laravel/public/

Add/update route in "laravel/app/Http/routes.php"

Create controller and view function "laravel/app/Http/Controllers"
	php artisan make:controller PagesController
	php artisan make:controller PagesController --plain
	php artisan help make:controller

Create HTML view within "laravel/resources/views"

Update DB credentials within "/opt/lampp/htdocs/laravel/.env"
	Can select DB adopters mentioned in "/opt/lampp/htdocs/laravel/config/database.php"
	"laravel/.env" are set to be ignored by GIT "/opt/lampp/htdocs/laravel/.gitignore"

All the configuration files reside in "/opt/lampp/htdocs/laravel/config/" folder.

Create DB migrations within "/opt/lampp/htdocs/laravel/database/migrations/"
	php artisan make:migration create_articles_table --create="articles"	

Run DB migrations
	php artisan migrate
	php artisan migrate:rollback

Edit table columns/structure
	php artisan make:migration add-excerpt_to_articles_table
	php artisan make:migration add-excerpt_to_articles_table --table="articles"

Create "Article" model (Eloquent Active Record)
	php artisan make:model Article

Using artisan tinker
	php artisan tinker

	>>> $name;
	>>> $article = new App\Article;
	>>> $article->title = 'My First Article';
	>>> $article->body = 'Lorem ipsum';
	>>> $article->published_at = Carbon\Carbon::now();
	>>> $article->toArray();
	>>> $article->save();
	>>> App\Article::all()->toArray();
	>>> $article = App\Article::find(1);
	>>> $article = App\Article::where('body', 'Lorem ipsum')->get();
	>>> $article = App\Article::where('body', 'Lorem ipsum')->first();
	>>> exit
	
	php artisan tinker
	>>> $article = App\Article::create(['title'=>'New Article', 'body'=>'New body', 'published_at'=>Carbon\Carbon::now()]); // No need to call "$article->save();"
	>>> $article->update(['body'=>'Updated AGAIN']);

	php artisan tinker
	>>> $user = new App\User;
	>>> $user->username = 'John Doe';
	>>> $user->email = 'john@example.com';
	>>> $user->password = Hash::make('password'); // Alternative syntax for Hash
	>>> $user->password = bcrypt('password');
	>>> $user->save();
	>>> $user->toArray();
	>>> $user->articles->toArray();
	>>> $user->articles();// Returns hasMany object, that allows further chaining
	>>> $user->articles()->get();// Returns collection
	>>> $user->articles()->get()->toArray(); // Returns data array
	>>> $user->articles()->where('title', 'new Article')->get();// Returns collection
	>>> $user->articles()->where('title', 'new Article')->get()->toArray();// Returns data array
	>>> $article = App\Article::first();
	>>> $article->user->toArray();
	>>> $user = App\User::where('username', 'John Doe')->first();// Process to get articles for "John Doe"
	>>> $user->toArray();
	>>> $articles =  $user->articles;
	>>> $articles->toArray();
	>>> $tag = new App\Tag;
	>>> $tag->name = 'personal';
	>>> $tag->save();
	>>> App\Tag::all()->toArray();
	>>> App\Tag::lists('name'); // Lists all the values for a given column
	>>> $article = App\Article::first();
	>>> $article->toArray();
	>>> $article->tags()->attach(1); // "attach(1)" takes "tag_id" to create association between articles and tags records by inserting in "article_tag" table
	>>> DB::select('select * from article_tag');
	>>> $article = App\Article::first();
	>>> $article->tags->toArray();
	>>> $article->toArray();
	>>> $article->tags->lists('name');
	>>> $tag = App\Tag::first();
	>>> $tag->toArray();
	>>> $tag->articles->toArray();




MVC Workflow
	Create Route ("laravel/app/Http/routes.php")
		Route::get('articles','ArticlesController@index');
	Make Controller
		php artisan make:controller ArticlesController --plain
	Impliment method in controller
	Create view for controller method ("laravel/resources/views/*controller_name*")

Forms
	Add "illuminate/html" package for forms
		composer require illuminate/html
	Add providers and aliases for "illuminate/html" (/opt/lampp/htdocs/laravel/config/app.php)

Laravel Form Requests
	php artisan make:request CreateArticleRequest

List defined routes
	php artisan route:list

Missing auth views
	https://github.com/laravel/laravel/commit/5e11f87de2c8f9303e6e296d74ec5f7f2093fd9b

Path to AuthenticatesAndRegistersUsers.php
	laravel/vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Foundation/Auth/AuthenticatesAndRegistersUsers.php
	The files arrangement is a bit changed then whats shown in videos.

Managing your Assets
	Check if node.js is installed (required by gulp)
		node -v
		npm -v
	Installing node.js and  node package manager (npm)
		sudo apt-get install nodejs
		sudo apt-get install npm
	Create a symbolic link for node, as many Node.js tools use this name to execute.
		//sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
	Install npm dependencies for node
		cd htdocs/laravel
		sudo npm install
		npm root
		npm config set prefix /usr/local
		npm root -g
		sudo npm install -g gulp
	Run GULP
		gulp
	Keep runing GULP in background (for css and js I belive but not for phpUnit tests)
		gulp watch
	Incase there is issue compiling coffee script
		You did not specifiy the name of the coffee script, so Elixir doesn't know what file it needs to compile. The only thing you need to do is specify 			the name of the script between the curly brackets like so:

		elixir(function(mix) {
		  mix.coffee('test.coffee');
		});
		There is also something called method chaining. This will allow you to run multiple tasks at once. If you add your Sass, your code should look 			something like this:

		elixir(function(mix) {
		  mix.sass('app.scss')
		     .coffee('test.coffee');
		});
	Compress/minify css/js while generation
		gulp --production
	Keep runing GULP in background (for phpUnit tests)
		gulp tdd



Pull-in package for "Flash messages"
	composer require laracasts/flash

Three steps of pulling-in a package
	1- composer require "PACKAGE NAME"
	2- include service provider in config/app.php
	3- include aliases in config/app.php


Rules for naming composite table, 
        => convert individual table names in singular form e.g. articles => article and tags => tag OR users => user and roles => role
        =>combine singular table names in alphabetical order sperated by underscore e.g. "article_tag" OR "role_user"

	if there already exists a composite table that doesn't meet nameing convention mentioned above
	you can specify that as second parameter to "belongsToMany()", 
	similarly if they have different ids they can also be specified as third and fourth parameters e.g.
	belongsToMany('App\Article','table_name','table_id', 'name_id');


Issue with displaying selected multi-select
	Article =>"return $this->tags->lists('id');" to "return $this->tags->lists('id')->toArray();"

Navigation HTML browed from here
	view-source:http://getbootstrap.com/examples/starter-template/
	// Used View Composer to set data required by navigation View partial on different pages


Repositories
	Like collection stores that can be used to take complex queries and 
	isolate them into methods with readable names  







Issues
	If a variable is used in the view but not passed from controller, it generates error, need to look into that.
	Unable to access "auth/register" page, after login, results in error.





Laravel 5 - Building Your First App

Installed Laravel Installer
	sudo composer global require "laravel/installer"

Set Laravel Installer path to $PATH
	/*** only active for your current terminal session ***/
	export PATH="$PATH:~/.composer/vendor/bin"
	/*** for checking if added to PATH ***/
	echo $PATH

Create Laravel Project
	laravel new dmca-app

Give write permissions to "htdocs/dmca-app" project folder
	sudo chmod 0777 -R dmca-app/

Workaround for missing app.blade.php
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30980906/laravel-5-1-app-and-home-blade-php-missing

	You didn't do anything wrong. The Auth Scaffolding was removed from Laravel 5.1. That includes the app.blade.php and the home.blade.php that you mentioned.

	However, you'll still be able to get it back with the Scafold Package :

	1.Add Scafold to your composer.json file in the require : section :

	require : {
		"laravel/framework": "5.1.*",
		"bestmomo/scafold": "dev-master"
	}
	or type from terminal :

	composer require bestmomo/scafold dev-master
	2.Update composer :

	composer update
	3.Add the service provider to your config/app.php :

	Bestmomo\Scafold\ScafoldServiceProvider::class,
	4.Publish the views and assets :

	php artisan vendor:publish
	Done!


To show file .env.example
	.env.example is hidden, select "Show Hidden Files" (Ctrl+H) to view it

Make sure to delete laravel's compiled file that groups things togather for performance purposes
	php artisan clear-compiled

Fetch "illuminate/html" component for Form
	composer require illuminate/html

Install any gulp and elixir dependencies mentioned in "dmca-app/package.json"
	sudo npm install

Made Form Request to validate the form.
	php artisan make:request PrepareNoticeRequest

Make migration for providers
	php artisan make:migration create_providers_table --create=providers
	php artisan migrate

Make model for providers
	php artisan make:model Provider

Make model for Notice
	php artisan make:model Notice

Make migration for Notice
	php artisan make:migration create_notices_table --create=notices
	php artisan migrate

Issues related to errors not displaying, enable php's "display_errors"
	//ini_set('display_errors', '1');

Issues related to permissions being overridden (e.g on running "gulp"), reassign permissions
	sudo chmod 0777 -R dmca-app/

Installing Guzzle HTTP library for Mandrill Driver (Mail API)
	sudo composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle:~5.3|~6.0

Installing "flash" package for session notifications
	sudo composer require laracasts/flash
